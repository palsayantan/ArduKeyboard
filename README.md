# ArduKeyboard 

*Macro keyboard based on ATmega328P.*

Keyboards are one of the most important input device for a computer. A standard keyboard has more than 100 different keys for different purposes. Yet sometimes it feels like it'd be great if there're **some programmable buttons** to execute certain **commands** or a particular set of **key combination**. Keeping that in mind I have designed this **Ardu Keyboard**, *a programmable macro keyboard based on popular ATmega328P microcontroller*. 

- It has 9 push buttons connected in a 3 by 3 matrix format. 
- ATmega328P DIP IC in bare minimum configuration
- A USB 2.0 male connector 
- CH340C USB to TTL converted IC, to talk to the microcontroller over USB.
